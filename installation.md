# MiB64 Installation

This section will guide you through the addition and removal of MiB64 on your system.

MiB64 1.0 Inclusive Archive, available [here](/dev/showthread.php?tid=424), is a portable emulator.  
All you need to do is **right-click** and **Extract Here** using your preferred file archiver software to a directory of your choosingâ€”then load and use.

If you do not have an archiver installed, we recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), which is free software and open source.
