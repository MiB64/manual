<h1 style="text-align:center">Preparing Your System for MiB64</h1>

Ideally do this *before* you start using MiB64.  
If you haven't, please read this page now anyway.

Make sure you have a **clean and stable system**, which means:

1. Have all the latest drivers installed for all your hardware—especially video hardware.
2. Close as many applications as possible. The emulator needs a lot of resources; the more you free, the better it will perform.
3. Defragment your hard drive. This can speed up game loading and improve swapfile performance.
4. Temporarily disable any virus checkers or scheduled tasks. If these start while you're playing, performance could suffer badly.

If you know your PC is not stable generally—maybe it locks up occasionally while playing PC games, or applications quit or crash for no apparent reason—**stop right here and get it fixed**.

The emulator pushes system components hard.  
Although it will not *cause* any damage, any existing stability problems your PC may have are likely to show up when you start using the emulator.
