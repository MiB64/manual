# Standard Installation (Portable and Self-Contained)

Since you're reading this, you've probably done this already—but it's included here for completeness.

MiB64 1.0 Inclusive Archive, available [here](/dev/showthread.php?tid=424), is a **portable emulator**.  
There is no install (or uninstall) program.

## Steps

1. **Right-click** and **Extract Here** using your preferred file archiver software to a directory of your choosing.  
   If you do not have one installed, we recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)—free and open source.

2. You will now see a folder named `MiB64 - 1.0`.

3. That's it! Run `MiB64_1.0.exe` (depending on your Windows operating system).

All the necessary files to get you started and playing N64 games are included—apart from [the games themselves](installing_games.md).

You will be asked to choose a language. Read more about this [here](language_files.md).

If you're not sure what to do next, refer to the [Using MiB64](using_mib64.md) section of this manual.
