## <center>Standard Installation (portable and self contained)</center>

MiB64 from the [MiB64 Releases](https://mib64.github.io/web-links#mib64-releases) is a Portable Emulator.  
Always make sure to get it from there for an official download to ensure you have the complete and unaltered package.  
This is very simple, there is no install (or uninstall) program, but it does include a Help/Reset Application Settings.

1. Right click and “Extract Here” with your preferred file archiver software to a directory of your choosing.  
   If you do not have one installed, we recommend [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), as 7-Zip is free software with open source.
2. You will now see a folder named `MiB64 - 1.0`
3. That's it! Run `MiB64_1.0.exe` (depending on your Windows Operating System)

All the necessary files to get you started and playing N64 games are included (apart from [the games themselves](installing-games)).

You will be asked to choose a language (read more about this [here](language-files)).

If you are not sure what to do next, please refer to the [Using MiB64](using-mib64) section of this manual.
