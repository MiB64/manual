# Welcome to the MiB64 User Manual

New users are encouraged to read through this document (or as much of it as you can stomach) before using the program.  
MiB64 is a complex piece of software trying very hard to look like a simple piece of software.  
Reading this file could save you time in the long run.

It’s probably a good idea to familiarise yourself with the [known issues](reference.md#known-issues) at the outset,  
so you aren't left wondering how to fix un-fixable things.

There are a few [conditions](terms_conditions.md) attached to the use of this file  
(doesn't concern people who just read it).

We hope you have as much fun using MiB64 as [we](credits.md) had making it.
