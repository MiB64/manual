## <center>MiB64 Minimum System Specification</center>

This specification will be sufficient for you to enjoy *most* compatible games with good graphics, sound, and control—subject to correct configuration and some limitations of the emulator.  
You may experience performance issues and won’t be able to use all emulator options.

---

### Operating System  
(No support for Windows Vista and below)

- Microsoft Windows 7 and up

### CPU

- Intel or AMD processor with at least SSE2 support

### RAM

- 512MB or more

### Graphics Card

- DirectX 8 capable (Icepir8s-MiB64-LLE)  
- OpenGL 3.3 capable (Icepir8s-MiB64-LLE)

The plugins contain SSE optimisations. Early Athlons did not have SSE.

---

The video device must be a **primary device**, with:

- At least 16MB local memory  
- Two texture units

Depending on your video card’s features, some content may not display correctly.  
Games marked as compatible may suffer glitches or fail to run depending on your hardware.  
Required features vary per game.

---

### Suggested Minimum Video Hardware

- nVidia GeForce256  
- ATI Radeon (early models)

These cards, paired with good drivers, meet the required feature set.  
Newer cards mainly improve resolution, filtering, and anti-aliasing.

---

### Below Minimum Specification

The following chipsets (and all cards based on them) are considered **below minimum spec**:

- 3dfx Voodoo 1, 2, 3 (1,2 not supported; 3 poor image quality)  
- ATI Rage128, Rage Pro  
- Intel i740, i810  
- Matrox G200, G400, G450  
- nVidia Riva128  
- S3 Savage 4, Savage 2000 (particularly unstable)

For a detailed explanation, see [Feature Lists](feature-lists).

You may find MiB64 usable on a lower-spec system, especially with certain games and careful configuration.  
If so, enjoy—but please don’t expect full performance or compatibility.
