## <center>Known Issues (Game Browser)</center>

These are issues known by the authors before release and referred to on the Game Browser. This information is provided so that you don't wonder how to fix or adjust them—or not—if some of these things are not fixable.

Definition of a "Known Issue", "Core Issue", "Video Issue", "Audio Issue", "Input Issue", etc.

You will see this used a lot on the browser, unfortunately. It simply means:

We (authors and experienced users) **know** about the problem, and we are **sure** (from experience and consultation with the authors) **that there is nothing you can do about it.**

Issues listed under "core" are problems within the `.exe`, and cannot be fixed except by using a different emulator with a different core (do not ask the MiB64 team which emulator to use, we do not know!).

Issues listed under "plugin" (or "[video]") etc. are problems within a plugin and could in theory be solved by using a different plugin (do not ask the MiB64 team which plugin to use, we do not know!).

On the other hand, if you have a solution or workaround to a problem that you want to share with fellow users (one that isn't already listed here, obviously!), please let us know via the [MiB64 Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/ha7HWAFE8u){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and if your answer proves useful to others it will be included. Many thanks in advance.
