# Installing Games

**N.B.** There are no games supplied with MiB64.  
It is your responsibility to acquire games.  
The MiB64 team cannot help you find commercial games for legal reasons.  
Requests for games are not welcome in official MiB64 areas of the Internet.

---

To use a game in MiB64, the game file simply needs to be available locally on your system.  
This could be your hard drive (recommended), a CD-ROM, or other removable media.  
Removable media may increase loading times, but emulation performance itself is unaffected.

It is not recommended to load games across a network.  
Apart from increased load times, there is a risk of corruption—though it has been found to work.

To view a game or collection of games in the MiB64 Game Browser, simply tell MiB64 where your games are:  
Select the folder via the File menu or right-click in the Browser.

## Points

1. Games must be uncompressed or compressed in **standard Zip format**. No other compression formats are supported.
2. Game files must have a standard N64 extension: `.z64`, `.v64`, `.rom`—or be inside a `.zip` file with one of these extensions.
3. Byte order is not important. MiB64 can read all standard byte orders. It does not affect emulation performance.
4. If using zipped games, there must be **only one game per zip file**. Compress files individually.
5. To arrange games in subfolders, choose the top-level folder and enable the [Directory Recursion option](app-rom-selection.md#Enable-Recursion). MiB64 will search all subfolders and list games together.
6. You cannot add games from separate folder trees. Consolidate them into one location.
7. There is no practical limit (AFAIK) to the number of games you can have—except for available storage space.
8. Zipped games do not affect emulation speed, only loading time (which may even be faster depending on your system).
