## <center>Installing Additional (3rd Party) Plugins</center>

By "3rd party", we mean any plugin not written by Azimer, Icepir8, or the MiB64 Team.

MiB64 uses an open plugin specification. This means other developers are free to write compatible plugins, which you might prefer to use instead of the ones provided. These may be available standalone or bundled with other emulator packages—visit reputable websites or use a search engine.

Before installing, check that the plugin conforms to the MiB64 specification and matches the correct version.  
We do not guarantee that 3rd party plugins will work correctly with MiB64, so consult the plugin or emulator documentation if unsure.

If you attempt to install a plugin that does not meet the specification, it may not appear in the MiB64 menus.

### Installing the Plugin

1. Extract the plugin (`.dll` file) and any required support files.
2. Place them in the root of your MiB64 plugin folder (by default, `\Plugin\` inside your MiB64 directory).
3. Start MiB64 and go to `Options > Settings > Plugins`.
4. Select the new plugin from the appropriate list and press OK.

If the plugin initializes correctly, there will be no error message.

> ⚠️ If you're using third-party plugins, the standard MiB64 compatibility lists and notes may no longer apply.

### Troubleshooting and Responsibility

If you encounter problems with a plugin, consult the appropriate author or group.  
The MiB64 team is not responsible for the performance of 3rd party plugins, nor can we guarantee the stability of MiB64 while using them.
