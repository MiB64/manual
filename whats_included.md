# What's Included in MiB64?

MiB64 1.0 was released as an inclusive archive.  
We recommend downloading MiB64 from the [MiB64 Homepage](web_links.md) or an official mirror to ensure you have the complete and unaltered package.

In simple terms, you get:

- The application
- The settings files (`.rds`, `.cdb`, `.rdi`, etc.)
- 1 audio plugin (a dummy "No audio" plugin)
- 1 video plugin (`Icepir8sMIBLLE`)
- 1 input plugin (`NRage_MiB_Input`)
- 1 internal RSP

You do **not** get any games included.  
Do **not** ask us for games. See [this page](installing_games.md).

The MiB64 source code is available from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MiB64/MiB64-public).  
Contributors are always welcome.
