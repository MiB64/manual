## What is MiB64?

MiB64 (hereon also referred to as simply "the emulator" or "the software") is a software package designed to emulate the Nintendo 64 video game system on a Microsoft Windows-based PC. It creates an environment on your PC under which real N64 software can run and be played in much the same way as it would on the original hardware system.

Due to the difficult nature of this task, lack of complete system documentation, and time and resource restrictions, this is achieved with varying degrees of success depending on factors including the specific game, the configuration of the emulator, the specification and configuration of the host system, and the inherent limitations of the emulator.

If you meet all the [requirements](min-specs) and follow the advice contained in this documentation, it should be possible for you to enjoy a wide selection of games—even with superior graphics and extra features compared to the original system.
