## <center>Installing Games</center>

N. B. There are no games supplied with MiB64. It is your responsibility to acquire games.  
The MiB64 team cannot help you find commercial games, for legal reasons.  
Requests for games are not welcome in official MiB64 areas of the Internet.

To use a game in MiB64, the game file simply needs to be available locally on your system.  
This could be your hard drive (recommended), a CD-ROM, or other removable media.  
Removable media may increase loading times, but emulation performance is unaffected.  
Loading games across a network is not recommended due to potential corruption, though it has been found to work.

To view a game or collection of games in the MiB64 Game Browser, simply tell MiB64 where your games are:  
Select the folder via the File menu or right-click in the Browser.

## Points

1. Make sure your games are either uncompressed or compressed in standard Zip file format. No other compression formats are supported.
2. Game files must use standard N64 extensions: `.z64`, `.v64`, `.rom`, or be inside a `.zip` archive.
3. Byte order does not affect performance—MiB64 supports all standard byte orders.
4. Only one game per zip file is allowed. Compress files individually using available tools.
5. To organize games in subfolders, choose the top-level folder and enable the [Directory Recursion option](app_rom_selection.html#Enable_Recursion). MiB64 will list all games together.
6. You cannot add games from separate directory trees. Consolidate them into one location.
7. There is no practical limit to the number of games, aside from your available storage space.
8. Zipped games do not affect emulation speed—only loading time, which may even be faster depending on your system.
