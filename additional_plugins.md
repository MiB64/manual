# Installing Additional (3rd Party) Plugins

By "3rd party", we mean any plugin not written by Azimer, Icepir8, or the MiB64 Team.

MiB64 uses an open plugin specification.  
This means other developers are free to write compatible plugins, which you might prefer to use instead of the ones provided.  
These may be available standalone or bundled with other emulator packagesâ€”visit quality websites or use a search engine.

---

## Compatibility Notes

Before installing:

- Check that the plugin conforms to the MiB64 specification and the correct version of that specification.
- MiB64 does **not guarantee** that 3rd party plugins will work correctly.
- Consult the plugin or emulator documentation if you're unsure.

If the plugin is not compatible, it will not appear in the MiB64 plugin menus.

---

## Installation Steps

1. Extract the plugin (`.dll` file) and any required support files to the root of your MiB64 plugin folder  
   *(default: `\Plugin\` subfolder of your MiB64 directory)*

2. Start MiB64 and go to:  
   `Options > Settings > Plugins`

3. Select the new plugin from the appropriate list and press OK

If the plugin initializes correctly, there will be no error message.

## Important Notes

- If you're using third-party plugins, the standard MiB64 compatibility lists and notes may no longer apply.
- If you encounter problems, consult the plugin author or group directly.
- The MiB64 team is **not responsible** for the performance of 3rd party plugins.
- We cannot guarantee the performance of MiB64 while using 3rd party plugins.
